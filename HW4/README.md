*Over the past two milestones, you've had the opportunity to apply several software engineering practices and processes in the design and implementation of a bot project.* 

# Design
***What was most helpful about thinking about design methods for your project?*** 

One of the most helpful things that helped with our design methods was developing UML diagrams. It was very helpful to be able to come up with different perspectives on what our bot would do during development of use cases. Doing so allowed us to consider how we would construct our software, how it would be limited and helped us to decide what implementations to emphasize over others. Developing the class diagram laid the framework for our technical implementation and gave us great direction on what and where to implement code. After developing the class diagram, problems arose as a result of technical knowledge rather than organizational skills.

***What was most difficult? What would you do differently? ***

The most difficult part of the design was figuring out the limitations of our project as well as rationalizing our expectations. Even though we all came from pretty much the same technical background, we still were not sure if we were over or under estimating our capabilities. We did not accurately consider the cost of learning a new language and how to operate a database, which affected our design process greatly. Now that we have more knowledge of how certain things work, I would choose softwares and languages that I am familiar with or that have lots of documentation online.

***What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?***

 I would definitely prioritize developing UML diagrams in the design process of a project in the future. Based on this project (and others involving UML diagrams) it proves to be a great investment in time and development in the long run.

 
# Implementation

***What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?***

The use of Github in our project proved to be the most helpful in implementing, testing, and especially integrating our project. As we divided the project into different methods (and furthermore, use cases) it was helpful to be able to look into other group members’ code and progress. Github also made merging almost effortless and worked great for tracking updates to the main code.

***What was most difficult? What would you do differently?***

The most difficult thing for me was finding out how python worked with firebase. The online documentation proved to be helpful, though it was quite a steep learning curve required to meet deadlines. There was also an issue of specifying the python-firebase connection to suit the needs of our objective. Again, I would dedicate more time into researching what we intend to use and also any alternatives with more online documentation. 

***What implementation, testing, and integration methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?*** 

I definitely intend on using Github again in future projects. I would also anticipate developing weekly meeting plans/progress reviews to ensure the project’s efficient development.


# Process
***What was most helpful about implementing kanban and code review in your project?*** 

Implementing Kanban and code review helped with our project's and group's organization tremenduosly. It was so easy to view and update the progress of our project using Githubs version of Kanban. The ability to link issues, use cases, branches, etc. into one central hub made it easy for everyone to be on the same page and equally informed about the progress of our project.

***What was most difficult? What would you do differently?***

There really was not much difficulty in implementing kanban and code review in our project. The hardest thing would be actually learning how to use Githubs version and figuring out how all the links work together to form a project. The hardest part in implementing code review was finding times that the group would be available to meet (in any format) to verbally discuss progress and plans.

***What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?***
The use of Kanban in our project proved to be vital to reaching deadlines and communication. I would also anticipate using this method of organization and planning in future projects.


# Overall
***Consider all the design methods, implementation practices, and software processes you've encountered---compare and contrast how the benefits of the different practices and how they might be useful together.***

All of the design methods, implementation practices, and software processing have various benefits that can be analyzed through lenses of time, organization, and communication. Some may require more time than others to implement (such as UML diagrams), but offer the greater reward of maintainablity in the long run. Others may require less time to implement, provided through already developed software (GitHub, Firebase Console), but may take time to learn prior to implementing. Software Process prompt discussion regarding organization, as these often help projects with a greater number of developers to organize their work and time. The Software process, such as Kanban, also helps developers communicate with each other -- a vital component of great teamwork. Using these things together will help the quality of the project as they encourage communication, organization, and maintainability.
